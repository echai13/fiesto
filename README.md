## NOTE: Because Google has deprecated it's getCurrentLocation API(), this does not work on Chrome and the geolocation will default to Brandeis. To test Geolocation, please visit on a different browser! 
## NOTE2: To view the heat-zone feature, it is advised to set radius to 6 because the distance from Brandeis to BU is between 6-8 miles away! Of course, if you are in a different location, then you will have to add Parties at various locations and experiment with that.

Team name:​ Fiesto

Meeting times:​ Sunday from 9-11pm

Purpose:​ To create a web-based application that allows users to find house
parties within a certain radius and connect with the host of the party. The application will also
support a social media component such as chat rooms, profiles, and party documentation.

Features:

● This application has a log-in/register screen and
database to store the information for each user. Users will make profiles and adjust their
party search radius there.

● In addition to the profiles, the application will incorporate a security feature where new
profiles will be checked to verify their identity. The security check will require users to
verify using their credit cards.

● Another security check follows to make sure that person is not affiliated with any
criminal activity.

● Transactions will be made through the credit card they registered with. The guests could
be charged a fee in order to help pay for party costs but such charges will not be applied
unless they actually attend the party. (even if they RSVP)

● This attendance verification can be done via the Geocoding Gem on the individual's
phone or via check-ins with the host.

● After the party, there is an after party social media platform for the users to post about the
event, share photos/videos, and connect with people met at the party.
